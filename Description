The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps people focus and be more productive by breaking work into 25-minute chunks, or "Pomodoros", followed by short breaks. The name comes from the Italian word pomodoro, which means "tomato", and refers to the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that was first used to test the method.
